Unsupervised learning:In this machine learnong algorithm LLM doesn't knows about the output it only sees the input and find a perfect relation
                      between looking over the patterns.
Input target pairs:

Parellel computing : When large data is divide into small parts for better computing.

Now using , pytorch(data loader) for large dataset and Tensor(here as a 2 dimensional array).
so basically the dataset that we provided gets converted into a 2D array due to tensor and that helps to give the next word by just shifting the array one.
